An operating system is a mega-manager. 
It coordinates access to memory, files, processes, and devices. 
The OS is the most crucial software required to run a computer. 
Three main functions include: 1. providing a user interface (UI), 2. managing programs, and 3. monitoring performance.

The UI is how a user engages with an OS.
When you enter data or receive information, the UI controls those actions.
There are two kinds of UI: graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line interface (CLI).
GUI allows a user to touch, point, tap, and click menus and icons.
CLI allows a user to type a line of keywords or key combinations.

The OS manages programs in use as well as processes that support those programs.
Single tasking OS systems can only run one application at a time.
Multitasking systems allow many programs to reside in memory simultaneously.
When multiple programs are running, the active program is in the foreground and the programs not immediately in use retreat to the background.
